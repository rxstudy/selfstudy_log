Reward $r$ is +1 for each grid being filled. In this example, actions are discrete and are dependent on the current state.\n",
    "2. Balance inverted pendulum, State is pole angle and cart velocity, action is force vector applied to the cart. Reward is a positive constant for each tick of time the pole managed to stay up. Here state is infinite as it is continuous.\n",
    "3. Chess, state is the board and actions are the currently allowed moves. Reward is 1 for winning, 0 for drawing and -1 for losing. The different is, the state depends on opponent's action as well and the reward is delayed until the game is ended."
