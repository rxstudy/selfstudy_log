    "The last row jumps up to maximum because it is best scenario to win for the player where the player has 21 points. The second last row (excluding the left side) is also high becaues the player has 20 and the dealer showing card that is 2 or above meaning that there is less chance for the dealer to reach 20 or 21. The value dips on the left side because the dealer has an ace which means that the dealer could use the ace to reach 21 much easier since there are 4 type of cards with value of 10. It is easier to draw from 4/13 suits."
